# MMAR: A Challenging Benchmark for Deep Reasoning in Speech, Audio, Music, and Their Mix üé∂üîç

Welcome to the MMAR repository! This project provides benchmark data and code designed to evaluate deep reasoning capabilities in the domains of speech, audio, music, and their combinations. We aim to push the boundaries of what machines can understand in these complex areas.

## Introduction

The MMAR benchmark challenges researchers and developers to create models that can effectively reason about audio-related tasks. By offering a diverse dataset, we encourage innovation and exploration in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Getting Started

To get started with MMAR, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/thameran/MMAR/releases). This release contains all necessary files to run the benchmark. 

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your preferred framework)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow
```

or 

```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch
```

## Dataset Description

The MMAR dataset consists of various audio samples categorized into speech, music, and mixed categories. Each sample is annotated with labels that indicate the complexity of reasoning required to interpret the content.

### Dataset Structure

- `speech/`: Contains audio files related to spoken language.
- `music/`: Contains musical compositions across various genres.
- `mixed/`: Contains samples that combine both speech and music.

### Data Format

Each audio file is provided in WAV format, with a corresponding CSV file that includes metadata and labels. 

## Installation

To install the MMAR package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thameran/MMAR.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd MMAR
```

3. Install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can start using the benchmark for your experiments. Here is a simple example of how to load the dataset and run a basic evaluation.

### Loading the Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the metadata
metadata = pd.read_csv('path/to/metadata.csv')
print(metadata.head())
```

### Running a Simple Model

You can implement a basic model to evaluate the dataset. Here‚Äôs a template:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load your audio data
# Your code to load audio goes here

# Define your model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(input_shape)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10)
```

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate your model, you can use:

```python
results = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
print("Test Loss, Test Accuracy:", results)
```

## Results

We encourage users to share their results and findings. Please document your experiments and submit them as pull requests. This way, we can collectively improve the benchmark and learn from each other‚Äôs work.
